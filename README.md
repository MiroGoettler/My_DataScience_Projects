# My DataScience Projects 

In this repository I present Data Science projects, which aim to show my skills and expertise with Python in typical Data Science use cases. The projects are created in Jupyter Notebook, with my comments and graphics to explain the details and objectives of each project.

1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analyses
3. (comming soon ...)
